# Mac-Services
These are all the applications and tools i use on my Mac that i have found to be useful. A curated list of apps, services, and tools I use on macOS. 

To begin, the package manager I use to install all of these apps is **Homebrew**.

You might ask, "But Alfredo, what is Homebrew?" In layman’s terms, it’s a **package manager for macOS** that makes installing and managing software easy from the command line.  

This is one of the first things I always set up whenever I boot up my Mac.
